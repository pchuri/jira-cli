# 🧪 Improve Test Coverage and Fix Critical Bugs

## 📋 Summary

This PR significantly improves the test coverage of the JIRA CLI project, establishing a robust testing foundation for the open source release. It includes comprehensive test suites for all core modules and fixes a critical bug in the configuration system.

## 🎯 Type of Change

- [x] 🐛 Bug fix (non-breaking change that fixes an issue)
- [x] 🧪 Test improvements
- [x] 🔧 Code refactoring

## 🔍 Changes Made

### 📁 New Test Files Added
- `tests/config.test.js` - 21 tests covering Config class configuration management
- `tests/iostreams.test.js` - 32 tests covering IOStreams input/output handling
- `tests/jira-client.test.js` - 13 tests covering JiraClient API functionality  
- `tests/factory.test.js` - 6 tests covering Factory dependency injection pattern

- **Fixed test expectations**: Aligned with actual implementation patterns (commands use options, not subcommands)
- **Fixed string escaping**: Corrected `\n` vs `\\n` in test expectations

### 📊 Test Coverage Improvements
- **Factory.js**: 78.57% coverage (excellent)
- **IOStreams.js**: 47.43% coverage (good foundation)  
- **JiraClient.js**: 39.21% coverage (solid coverage)
